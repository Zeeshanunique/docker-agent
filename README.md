## Building AI Agents using Docker and Claude 3.5 Sonnet for Dataset Generation and Fine-tuning

### Project Overview

This project aims to develop AI agents using Docker and Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet to generate high-quality datasets for fine-tuning machine learning models. The project involves creating a scalable environment with Docker, integrating Claude 3.5 Sonnet for data generation, and establishing automated pipelines for dataset curation and model enhancement.

### Objectives

1. **Set Up Docker Environment**: Create an isolated and scalable environment using Docker.
2. **Integrate Claude 3.5 Sonnet**: Utilize Claude 3.5 Sonnet for synthetic data generation.
3. **Automate Data Generation**: Develop workflows to automate the generation of diverse and high-quality datasets.
4. **Dataset Curation**: Implement methods for curating and preprocessing datasets.
5. **Fine-tuning Machine Learning Models**: Enhance machine learning models using the generated datasets.
6. **Testing and Validation**: Ensure the fine-tuned models meet performance metrics and generalize well.

### Key Deliverables

1. **Dockerized Environment**: A functional Docker setup for deploying AI agents with Claude 3.5 Sonnet.
2. **Data Generation Pipeline**: Automated pipelines for dataset creation and curation.
3. **Curated Datasets**: High-quality datasets ready for model fine-tuning.
4. **Fine-tuned Models**: Enhanced machine learning models with improved performance.
5. **Documentation**: Detailed setup, usage, and maintenance instructions.
